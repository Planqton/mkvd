# mkvd

A simple GUI tool for marking video segments and exporting them as MP3.
It can also export the entire audio track and shows basic metadata about
the loaded media file. Exported segment files include the original video
name followed by the segment name (e.g. `video - intro.mp3`). The full
audio export uses just the video name with an `.mp3` extension.
